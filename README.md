## NOTICE:  NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW, HAVE TO FIX DUE TO SOLANA MIGRATION
### What is this?

This app shows you how many Helium hotspot miners are close to (or far from) your current location.

The way it works is:

1. You grant the site permission to use your GPS location.
2. You type in the distance in the input box, in either miles or meters depending on yoou selection.
3. The number of hotspots within your chosen distance is returned to the screen, as well as a few bits on information.

### So why did I make this?

This was made so I didn't have to use the helium explorer to see how many helium hotspots are close to me.
That just seemed like to much work for that piece of information.
